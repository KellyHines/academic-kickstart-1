It was such an honor to be nominated, let alone named a finalist, for the UW Graduate School's<a href="https://grad.uw.edu/for-students-and-post-docs/post-doctoral-affairs/graduate-school-mentoring-award-for-postdoctoral-trainees/">Postdoc Mentoring Award</a> by our grad students in the Xu Lab! It's been a rewarding experience to work with our students these past four years and I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn to be a mentor.
