I am very excited to announce that I'll be joing the <a href="https://www.chem.uga.edu/" target="_blank">Chemistry Department at University of Georgia</a> in Fall 2019 as an Assistant Professor! Research in the Hines Lab will focus on the development of ion mobility and mass spectrometry approaches to further our understand of the aberrant biochemical processes contributing to human disease and illness, including the emergence of antibiotic resistance in pathogens of high-concern.
