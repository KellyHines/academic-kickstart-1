  <p class="page-subtitle">Dr. Hines to join UGA Chemistry in Fall 2019</p>


<p>I am very excited to announce that I'll be joining the <a href="https://www.chem.uga.edu/" target="_blank">Chemistry Department at University of Georgia</a> in Fall 2019 as an Assistant Professor! Research in the Hines Lab will focus on the development bioanalytical ion mobility and mass spectrometry approaches to further our understanding of the aberrant biochemical processes that contribute to human disease and illness, including the emergence of antibiotic resistance in pathogens of high-concern. </p>

<p>Anyone and everyone interested in R/Data Science should join the group. We encourage members to actively participate, contributing as learners, teachers, developers or innovators! We encourage women and minority genders to present/lead most sessions, conversations but we have no restrictions whatsoever about who can participate in membership, discussions and other activities. Please join us and bring your R-family &amp; R-friends!</p>
