Dr. Kelly Hines will be joining the <a href="https://www.chem.uga.edu/" target="_blank">Chemistry Department at University of Georgia</a> in Fall 2019. The Hines Lab will develop novel bioanalytical ion mobility and mass spectrometry approaches to further our understanding of the aberrant biochemical processes that contribute to human disease and illness, including the emergence of antibiotic resistance in pathogens of high-concern.
