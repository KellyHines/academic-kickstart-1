# Abstract.
abstract = "Bacillithiol (BSH) has been prepared on the gram scale from the inexpensive starting material, d-glucosamine hydrochloride, in 11 steps and 8â€“9% overall yield. The BSH was used to survey the substrate and metal-ion selectivity of FosB enzymes from four Gram-positive microorganisms associated with the deactivation of the antibiotic fosfomycin. The in vitro results indicate that the preferred thiol substrate and metal ion for the FosB from *Staphylococcus aureus* are BSH and Ni(II), respectively. However, the metal-ion selectivity is less distinct with FosB from *Bacillus subtilis*, Bacillus anthracis, or *Bacillus cereus*."
