# Abstract.
abstract = "Previous work suggests that altered lipid metabolism may be associated with daptomycin resistance in Gram-positive pathogens, but lipidomic changes underlying resistance are not fully understood. We performed untargeted lipidomics by using three-dimensional hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-ion mobility-mass spectrometry (HILIC-IM-MS) to characterize alterations in the lipidomes of daptomycin-susceptible and -resistant isogenic strain pairs of *Enterococcus faecalis*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, and *Corynebacterium striatum*. We first validated the HILIC-IM-MS method by replicating the expected alterations of phospholipid metabolism in the previously studied *E. faecalis* strain pairs, such as reduced phosphatidylglycerols (PGs), while also revealing additional changes in cardiolipins (CLs), lysyl-PGs, and glycolipids. Whole-genome sequencing of the *S. aureus* and *C. striatum* strains found that daptomycin resistance was associated with mutations in *pgsA*, which encodes phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase, as well as mutations in genes affecting fatty acid biosynthesis and cell wall metabolism. Lipidomics revealed significantly decreased levels of PGs, CLs, and amino acid-modified PGs, as well as accumulation of lipids upstream of PGs, such as glycolipids and phosphatidic acids, in the resistant strains. Notably, the glycolipids, diglucosyldiacylglycerols, were significantly elevated in a fatty acid-dependent manner in the daptomycin-resistant *S. aureus* strain. In daptomycin-resistant *C. striatum*, which has a unique cell envelope architecture, the glycolipids, glucuronosyldiacylglycerols, and phosphatidylinositols were significantly elevated. These results demonstrate that alteration of lipid metabolism via mutations in *pgsA* is a common mechanism of daptomycin resistance in two distinct species of Gram-positive bacteria and point to the potential contribution of altered glycolipid and fatty acid compositions to daptomycin resistance."
